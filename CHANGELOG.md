Operators, you should copy/paste content of this content straight to your `firehose-<chain>` project. It is written and meant to be copied over to your project.

#### Operator Changes

* Added `fire<chain> tools check forks <forked-blocks-store-url> [--min-depth=<depth>]` that reads forked blocks you have and prints resolved longest forks you have seen. The command works for any chain, here a sample output:

    ```log
    ...

    Fork Depth 3
    #45236230 [ea33194e0a9bb1d8 <= 164aa1b9c8a02af0 (on chain)]
    #45236231 [f7d2dc3fbdd0699c <= ea33194e0a9bb1d8]
        #45236232 [ed588cca9b1db391 <= f7d2dc3fbdd0699c]

    Fork Depth 2
    #45236023 [b6b1c68c30b61166 <= 60083a796a079409 (on chain)]
    #45236024 [6d64aec1aece4a43 <= b6b1c68c30b61166]

    ...
    ```

* The `fire<chain> tools` commands and sub-commands have better rendering `--help` by hidden not needed global flags with long description.
